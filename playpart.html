        Mrs. Stockmann. Are you in, Thomas?<br>

Dr. Stockmann (from within his room). Yes, I have just come in. (Comes
into the room.) What is it?<br>

Mrs. Stockmann. A letter from your brother.<br>

Dr. Stockmann. Aha, let us see! (Opens the letter and reads:) "I return
herewith the manuscript you sent me" (reads on in a low murmur) H'm!â€”<br>

Dr. Stockmann (putting the papers in his pocket). Oh, he only writes
that he will come up here himself about midday.<br>

Mrs. Stockmann. Well, try and remember to be at home this time.<br>

Dr. Stockmann. That will be all right; I have got through all my
morning visits.
