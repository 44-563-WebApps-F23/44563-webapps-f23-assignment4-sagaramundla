        Mrs. Stockmann. Are you in, Thomas?<br>

        Dr. Stockmann (from within his room). Yes, I have just come in. (Comes
        into the room.) What is it?<br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. A letter from your brother.<br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Aha, let us see! (Opens the letter and reads:) "I return
        herewith the manuscript you sent me" (reads on in a low murmur) H'm!â€”<br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. What does he say?<br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann (putting the papers in his pocket). Oh, he only writes
        that he will come up here himself about midday.<br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. Well, try and remember to be at home this time.<br>
        
        Dr. Stockmann. That will be all right; I have got through all my
        morning visits.<br>
